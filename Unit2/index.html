    <h1>How to Spice Up Your Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwhich</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p> Many people think that it's easy to make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwhich. 'Just slap some peanut butter to
      one side of bread and jelly to the other. <b>BAM!</b> A PB&J has been made'. There is so much more to making the sandwhich, so today I give you some ways to spice up your sandwhich.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><h2>What Jelly Should You Use?</h2>
        Not that I can tell you what to do and what not to do, but most people go for the classic grape jelly without even thinking of the possible alternatives. Be adventurous, try new things, try <i>Different <b>JELLIES</b></i>.
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Apricote Jelly</h3>
        Truly the peak of flavor is reached when you use Apricote Jelly. This flavor has become a staple in my household and it should be in yours too.</li>
        <li><h3>Peach Jelly</h3>
        Nothing beats the sweet taste of peach, so why not use it for your next PB&J? Peach is just factually awesome, so there's no reason why you shouldn't give it a chance.</li>
        <li><h3>Blueberry Jelly</h3>
        Though it isn't as exciting as as the previous two flavors, blueberry still has a lot to offer. It brings a tartness to your sandwhich that the other two don't have. This flavor is one that is often overlooked.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><h2>What to Use Besides Peanut Butter?</h2>
      Though Peanut Butter is considered by some the only option to use in a Peanut Butter Sandwhich, some people may not always want to use peanut butter. Here are some different options that shouldn't be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>   
          <li><h3>Sunflower Butter</h3>
        Both tree nut and peanut free, the Sunflower Butter is made from sunflower seeds. Although it tastes similar to Peanut Butter it has an earthy undertone and many health benefits.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some Nutritions Included Are:
        <ol type=a>
          <li>Vitamin E</li>
          <li>Pantothenic Acid</li>
          <li>Vitamin B6</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li><h3>Cream Cheese</h3>
        Though it's not the same as butter, <i>it doesn't even have butter in the name</i>, it's still spreadable. It gives a unique flavor to any sandwhich and pairs well with many jellies.</li>
        <li><h3>Hazelnut Butter</h3>
        It would be hard not to pick Hazulnut Butter out of all of the previous options, but it's application is of course limitied. It's an overall sweet spread, so it's only ever going to offer a sweet flavor to your sandwhich.
      </ul></li>
