  <h1>Why Foxes are the Best Animals</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>It's no secret that foxes are pretty cool animals, <i>I mean who would think otherwise.</i> However, some people like other animals like dogs, deer, or birds. To combat these <b>strange</b> obsessions with other creatures, here's a list as to why foxes are the best overall.</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><h3>Foxes come in many different shapes and sizes!</h3>
      There are many different species of foxes. From the white and fluffy Arctic fox to the small Fennec fox, there is a fox for everyone to appreciate.</li>
    <li><h3>Domesticated foxes exist!</h3>
      Starting in 1959, a project to domesticate foxes began in the Soviet Union. Though there were many complications, the project has been considered a success and many people have now started to own foxes as pets!</li>
    <li><h3>Foxes are nocturnal animals!</h3>
      Foxes are often compared to cats because of their similar behaviors. One thing that they share is their nocturnal habits. Foxes have special pupils that expand at night to help them see in the dark, making it much easier for them to hunt prey!</li>
    <li><h3>Different species of fox has its own unique skills!</h3>
      Because of the many different types of foxes, each has their own special quirks that make them unique. Gray foxes can actually climb up trees and retract their claws. Arctic foxes have thick and fluffy fur to protect them from the harsh winter wind. The Bat-eared fox is able to use its big ears to regulate its body tempurature.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Some people may not be convinced that foxes are the superior animal choice, so here are some <b>extra</b> reasons as to why foxes are the best animals.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>There is a species of fox that eats crabs!</h3>
      The wood fox, <i>also know at the crab-eating fox</i>, will eat many different crabs and crustaceans during the wet season.</li>
    <li><h3>Tibetan foxes have the most distinct head shape!</h3>
    The Tibetan fox lives in the grass lands of the Tibetan Plateau. Its most unique feature is its square head that no other fox seems to have. </li>
    <li><h3>Vulpes qiuzhudingi!</h3>
    The Vulpes qiuzhudingi is an extinct species of fox that is believed to be the Arctic foxes' ancestor. Its fossils were found in the Himilayans and can be traced back at least 3.6 million years ago.</li>
